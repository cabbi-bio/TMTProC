The TMTProC module is the group of Matlab scripts associated with our paper "TMTPro Complementary Ion Quantification Increases Plexing and Sensitivity for Accurate Multiplexed Proteomics at the MS2 Level".

Files are analyzed using the "TMTProc_masterscript.m" script. Inputs include a reporter quant output file, which channels were used, and the S:N cutoff. Script outputs a matlab object with the deconvolved signal ratios in the complementary peaks and summary plots.
